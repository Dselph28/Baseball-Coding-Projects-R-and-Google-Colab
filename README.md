# Baseball-Coding-Projects-R-and-Google-Colab
This is my work in R from what I have in school, and in this project, I projected some of the top hitters in the NPB to see how they would perform in the MLB. I used sources like Baseball Reference, MLB.com, and Baseballguru.com with Jim Albright's articles on Sadaharu Oh. First project in R with baseball, was proud of my work.
